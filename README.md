Originally developed for Golden Grizzly Servers.

The current systems implemented are:
- Fully custom GUI library, which replaces the default GUI elements for Garry's Mod with more stylish ones
- Custom main menu, which can be used to access the donation webpage, the forums, or change game settings
- Hitmarker for sensory feedback when an enemy is hit
- Levelling system, which is yet to be complete, but has the core functionality of adding XP and levelling up
- Full loadout selection menu, where the user can select a team, then select a primary weapon and a secondary weapon (depending on their level)
- Local player chat and a radio system for players to communicate to their team
- Anti-team kill system and anti-spawn kill system

The weapons of the loadout menu or the teams can easily be configured using the corresponding sh files.
